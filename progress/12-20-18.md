Today I made a ton of progress on the animation library. I
got close to finishing up a sequencer for animations to make
it easy to string animations on 'screens' together.
I also found an interesting pattern to break up huge
components, where you break out huge chunks of code into
separate files that hold a function that returns that
chunk of JSX. Then you pass in the parent to that function to
access the parent's state and methods.
